FCode Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidydata.txt. Identifiers

subject - The ID of the test subject - A total of 30 subjects
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken .
 A total of 6 activities performed. 
For each subject (out of 30) 68 different measurements (listed under) are taken while performing 6 different activities . Hence a total of 180 observation sets.

Activity Labels

WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

Belows are all the measurements:
